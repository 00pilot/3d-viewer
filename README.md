Go to [https://unfavorablesemicircle.github.io/3d-viewer/](https://unfavorablesemicircle.github.io/3d-viewer/) for the online 3d composite viewer.

## To add new composites ##
- Add the image to the root directory. It must be a BMP, and the file name shouldn't have spaces.
- Add the file name to the list in `ufsc3d.pde`, following the format of the others.
- Images larger than 50 MB should be split into smaller files. It's also helpful to split multi-paneled images like HARVEST or GOLDEN into multiple images.
